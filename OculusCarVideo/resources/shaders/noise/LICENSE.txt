This software is provided under the permissive "MIT license",
as stated below. The license is officially approved by OSI as an
open source license. It is less restrictive than e.g. the GPL in
that it is compatible with closed-source commercial use without
charge and without sharing modifications you make, but you need
to give credit to the original authors wherever you use the code
or derivatives of it. Credit does not necessarily have to be
presented to every end-user of the software, but it should be
present in the source code and in "about" pop-ups, program
documentation and the like. You must also include a copy of the
license and the copyright notice below in all your distributions.

The code is specifically not public domain, and you may not claim
that you wrote it yourself, either explicitly by putting yourself
down as the sole author of derivative work, or implicitly by
removing the names of the original authors or the license terms.

You may share this code freely, but you must not sub-license it
under a different license, neither a more nor a less restrictive
one. If the MIT license does not suit your needs, you should
contact the original authors to negotiate a different license.
